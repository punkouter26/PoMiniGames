# PoMiniGames

Instant-play mini-games platform: a .NET 10 Minimal API host that also serves its
Blazor WebAssembly client from a single origin (port 5000), with SignalR for real-time
multiplayer, Azure Table Storage for persistence, and Azure AI Foundry behind the
AI-powered games.

## Quick start

```powershell
# prerequisites: .NET SDK 10.0.400 (global.json), Docker
docker compose up -d azurite                                  # local table storage
dotnet run --project src/PoMiniGames.API/PoMiniGames.API.csproj
# → http://localhost:5080  (API + client, one origin)

pwsh scripts/test-all.ps1                                     # full test suite
```

```

## Notes

- Auth: Microsoft Entra (BFF cookie pattern) plus guest login; leaderboard reads are
  anonymous, all game-data writes require auth + antiforgery.
- UI is native Blazor + plain CSS by design — no heavy component libraries.
- Offline-friendly PWA: finished scores park locally and sync on reconnect/sign-in.
- Deploy: `azd up` (App Service F1, resource group `PoMiniGames`).

PoRacer ranks **best completed laps**, separately from final race times. Its legacy JSON
field and Azure Table column `totalTimeSeconds` / `TotalTimeSeconds` retain their names
for stored-score compatibility; existing rows are preserved without inferred conversion.
Run `pwsh scripts/test-ceilings.ps1` to check all four test-method budgets without Docker.
CI validates Bicep and deploys application code; use `azd up` for resource provisioning.
