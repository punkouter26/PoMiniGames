# PoMiniGames

Instant-play mini-games platform: a .NET 10 Minimal API host that also serves its
Blazor WebAssembly client from a single origin (port 5080), with SignalR for real-time
multiplayer, Azure Table Storage for persistence, and Azure AI Foundry behind the
AI-powered games.

## Overview

Fifteen small games on one website. The browser runs each game in full, including its
computer opponents; the server signs players in, referees online play, checks and stores
scores, and talks to AI models on the player's behalf.

- **One origin.** The API host serves the Blazor client it is then called by, so there is no
  cross-site setup in production.
- **Each game is a Razor page plus a JavaScript engine** (`wwwroot/js/<game>/`), loaded on
  demand and wired together with JS interop callbacks.
- **Online play runs over 15 SignalR hubs.** Match, lobby and race state is held in server
  memory and is lost on restart.
- **No database.** Scores, ratings, saves and AI spend ledgers live in Azure Table Storage;
  PoEcosystem world files live in Blob Storage. A player is whoever the sign-in token says
  they are; there is no Player table.
- **Computer opponents are hand-written rules, not trained models.** Difficulty is a table of
  numbers in source. The exceptions are hosted models: Azure AI Foundry chat models write
  jokes, quizzes, banter and chronicles, and TypeSafe's Jev makes PoJevArena's battle calls.
  Each has a daily cap per player and a scripted fallback.
- **Works offline.** A score that cannot reach the server is parked in the browser and sent
  automatically later.

## Quick start

```powershell
# prerequisites: .NET SDK 10.0.400 (global.json), Docker
docker compose up -d azurite                                  # local table storage
dotnet run --project src/PoMiniGames.API/PoMiniGames.API.csproj
# → http://localhost:5080  (API + client, one origin)

pwsh scripts/test-all.ps1                                     # full test suite
```

## Notes

- Auth: Microsoft Entra sign-in in the browser (MSAL), sent to the API as a bearer token.
  Guest login exists only in Development/Test and only from loopback. The whole app sits
  behind the sign-in gate; leaderboard reads are anonymous at the API, and all game-data
  writes require auth + antiforgery.
- UI is native Blazor + plain CSS for fourteen of the games. PoMule is the first screen built
  on Radzen (Material Dark); the hub, settings, leaderboards and the other games move to
  Radzen next. Until then PoMule's page loads the Radzen stylesheet itself and removes it on
  the way out.
- **Each game is a Razor page plus a JavaScript engine, except PoMule**, whose rules are C# in
  `PoMiniGames.Shared/Games/PoMule` (unit-tested, seeded, deterministic) with JavaScript only
  drawing and moving the avatars. See `SPEC.md`, `CAPABILITY-MAP.md` and `tasks/`.
- Offline-friendly PWA: finished scores park locally and sync on reconnect/sign-in.
- Deploy: `azd up` (App Service F1, resource group `PoMiniGames`).

PoRacer ranks **best completed laps**, separately from final race times. Its legacy JSON
field and Azure Table column `totalTimeSeconds` / `TotalTimeSeconds` retain their names
for stored-score compatibility; existing rows are preserved without inferred conversion.
Solo races have 99 AI rivals and spectator demos have 100 AI cars; online rooms remain
capped at 8 cars. The minimap is removed. Add `?perf=1` to a PoRacer URL and inspect
`window.PoRacer.getPerformanceProfile()` for frame rates and render-stage timings.
Track bitmaps respect the canvas pixel budget, including backing-store ratios below 1,
without rebuilding on every frame.
Join/rejoin snapshot numbers use Blazor's direct byte-array interop transfer rather than
JSON-formatting 1,400 floating-point values on the browser's WASM main thread.
Streaming snapshots retain the existing SignalR wire format but are decoded in native
JavaScript; only the four visible standings rows return to Blazor. All cars still feed
interpolation, rendering, and audio, and the HUD's field size comes from the complete roster.
Run `node --test tests\poracer-snapshot.test.mjs` for focused native snapshot coverage.
Run `pwsh scripts/test-ceilings.ps1` to check all four test-method budgets without Docker.
Run `node --test tests/pomule-world.test.mjs tests/pomule-physics.test.mjs` for PoMule's renderer maths.
CI validates Bicep and deploys application code; use `azd up` for resource provisioning.
