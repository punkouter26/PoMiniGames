/// <b>Why this exists.</b> PoCoupleQuiz scored answer similarity by spending a whole chat
/// completion to obtain a single float between 0 and 1 — a generative call, priced as one, doing a
/// job that is not generative. An embedding pair plus a cosine is cheaper by orders of magnitude,
/// and it is <em>deterministic</em>: the same two answers produce the same score forever, so the
/// result can be cached without an expiry and without worrying that the model drifted.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It also fixes a correctness problem the chat path had. When the model's reply carried no
/// <c>score</c> field, the scorer returned <c>0f</c> — a value indistinguishable from "these
/// answers are completely unrelated". A failed call and a confidently wrong answer scored the same.
/// Cosine either produces a number or throws.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Optional by construction.</b> <see cref="IsConfigured"/> is false when no embedding
/// deployment is set, and callers fall back to their chat path. This is not defensive
/// over-engineering: the deployment inventory verified on the shared account (2026-07-29) contains
/// no embedding model at all, so on today's account this service is dormant and PoCoupleQuiz still
/// scores via chat. Deploying <c>text-embedding-3-small</c> and setting
