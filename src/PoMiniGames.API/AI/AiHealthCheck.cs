/// oddly, and was diagnosed from logs after the fact.

/// <para>
/// <b>Deliberately does not call the model.</b> A health check runs on every probe; making it
/// issue a completion would put a paid call on a schedule and, on an account whose measured
/// request quota is around one concurrent call, would itself contend with players. It reports what
/// the process already knows: whether the foundry is configured, and what the recorded outcome of
/// real traffic has been. That is a lagging signal, and honest about it — a deployment with no
/// traffic yet is <see cref="HealthStatus.Healthy"/> with "no calls recorded", not a false alarm.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Unconfigured is <see cref="HealthStatus.Healthy"/> outside Production and
/// <see cref="HealthStatus.Unhealthy"/> in it: a dev machine with no Key Vault access is expected
/// to have no foundry, whereas a Production host without one cannot serve four of its games.
