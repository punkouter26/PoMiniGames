/// The budget's ledger is a <c>ConcurrentDictionary</c> in the host process, which makes the
/// 250k/day ceiling only as durable as the process. This app runs on App Service <b>F1</b>, which
/// cannot enable AlwaysOn (see the deploy workflow's prewarm loop) — so the host is recycled
/// whenever the site goes idle, and every recycle silently reset every caller's allowance to zero.
/// The documented "daily ceiling" was in practice a per-uptime ceiling, which is exactly the bound
/// that does not hold when someone leaves a tab open overnight.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Increments, never absolutes.</b> Same argument as the PoBrawl demo-mode Elo board: the write
/// is <c>Spent += delta</c> under an ETag, so two hosts (or a host and a replayed flush) compose
/// instead of one clobbering the other. An absolute write computed from a stale read would lose
/// whatever landed in between, and losing spend is the one direction that costs money.
