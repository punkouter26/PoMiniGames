/// <para>
/// Each AI-consuming slice previously reached into <see cref="AIFoundryChatClientCache"/> itself
/// and used the bare client. That left every cross-cutting guarantee opt-in, and every slice opted
/// out: the resilience pipeline had no consumers at all, and no call site recorded token usage.
/// Composing here means a slice gets the whole posture by asking for its client:
/// </para>

/// ResilientChatClient          // total-call budget, retry, circuit breaker
///   └─ BudgetedChatClient      // per-identity daily token ceiling
///        └─ InstrumentedChatClient  // token/latency logging, health tracking
///             └─ foundry ChatClient // the cached per-deployment client
/// </code>
/// <para>
/// The decorators nest in that order on purpose: telemetry inside the pipeline measures one
/// attempt's real service latency, and counts a retried attempt as the failure it was. The spend
/// ceiling sits between them — inside the pipeline so a refusal is not retried and does not count
/// toward the circuit breaker, outside the telemetry so a refused call is not recorded as a
/// provider failure. A caller out of allowance is not a sick deployment.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Composition is per <b>deployment</b>, not per game, because <c>/api/infer</c> lets a caller
/// select a model from the server-side allowlist. The first cut of this took the game's client
/// from DI and reached past it to the bare cache for any other deployment — so the moment the
/// client actually used per-request selection (which it does on every call, naming the deployment
/// the status endpoint reported), every guarantee here was bypassed again and the telemetry went
/// silent. One decorated client per deployment, cached, is what keeps that from being possible.
