/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Signed, not stored.</b> The whole payload rides in the token, protected by the same
/// Data Protection key-ring that encrypts the auth cookies, so there is no table to read on the
/// submission path and nothing to clean up. It also means the app's existing key-ring semantics
/// apply: a key rotation invalidates outstanding sessions, which presents as
/// <see cref="PlaySessionStatus.Malformed"/> and, in Observe mode, is a logged non-event.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Deliberately reusable.</b> Marking a session single-use is the obvious hardening and is
/// wrong here: a player who runs three marble races without leaving the page submits three
/// scores against one session, and rounds two and three would be rejected. The token's value is
/// the start timestamp, and reusing it only ever yields a LONGER elapsed — the conservative
/// direction — so reuse costs the guard nothing. The stale-token hole that opens up (mint,
/// wait an hour, claim an hour's worth of points) is closed by capping credited elapsed at
/// <see cref="IntegrityOptions.MaxCredited"/> instead.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this is not.</b> It is a deterrent tier, not a proof of play: a determined attacker
/// can mint a session, wait the honest duration, and submit a plausible score. Ranking that out
/// requires per-round minting with a server-held round record, which is the upgrade path. What
/// this does buy is that a forged score must now be paced in real time and stay inside the
