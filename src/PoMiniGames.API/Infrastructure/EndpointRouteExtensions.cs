/// call, so the route table is described in exactly one place.
///
/// The authenticated game API is one <c>MapGroup("/api")</c>: the prefix is declared
/// once here and every slice below mounts a relative group under it, so the shared
/// <c>/api</c> segment and the auth gate that guards it are stated in the same place.
/// (This was <c>MapGroup("")</c> until 2026-09-11, with all twenty-odd slice groups
/// repeating the literal <c>/api</c> — which meant the boundary the antiforgery filter
/// keys on was invisible at the registration site.) Anonymous surfaces below are mapped
/// straight on <c>app</c> and therefore still spell their full path. SignalR hubs are mapped directly on
/// <c>app</c> because <c>MapHub&lt;T&gt;</c> returns <c>IHubEndpointConventionBuilder</c>,
