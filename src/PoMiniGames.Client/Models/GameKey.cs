// The GameKey value object itself lives in PoMiniGames.Domain.Primitives and is
// re-exported here under the client's Models namespace.
//
// There used to be two of them: this file declared its own `readonly record struct
// GameKey` with the same purpose, the same implicit string conversions and the same
// case-insensitive equality as the Domain one. Two implementations of one concept is
// how the catalogues drifted apart in the first place — the client's list said
// "pofunquiz" while the Domain catalogue said "funquiz", and the leaderboard endpoint
// grew a `"pofunquiz" or "funquiz"` switch to paper over it.
//
// A using-alias rather than a wrapper: the client needs the type under
// PoMiniGamesClient.Models (every razor page resolves it from there via _Imports),
// but it must be the SAME type as the server validates against, not a lookalike.
