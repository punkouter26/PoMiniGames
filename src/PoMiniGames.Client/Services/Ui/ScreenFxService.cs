/// The visual half of the feedback stack, reachable from C#. Particles
/// (<c>gpuFx.js</c>, WebGL2 with a WebGPU compute backend) and screen feel
/// (<c>impactBus.js</c> — trauma shake, punch, flash, hitstop) without an
/// accompanying sound.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this exists.</b> Both systems were reachable only as a side effect of
/// firing a named cue through <see cref="UiFeedbackService"/>, and a cue only
/// carries particles if its table entry happens to declare an <c>fx</c> block.
/// The consequence was that the Blazor-rendered games — TicTacToe, ConnectFive,
/// the quizzes — and every non-game surface had no way to emit a burst at all,
/// while the JS-engine games called <c>window.PoFx</c> directly and got the lot.
/// Nothing in C# referenced either global.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is deliberately the *silent* surface. Anything that should make a noise
/// belongs in the cue vocabulary (<c>gameCues.js</c>) so the sound, the impact
/// envelope and the particles stay welded together — see
/// <see cref="UiFeedbackService.CueAsync"/>. Reach for this only when the visual
/// is the whole point: a rank climbing, a queue draining, a settings preview.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Failure modes</b>: silent, like the rest of the feedback stack. The FX
/// globals are module scripts that may not have evaluated yet on the first
/// paint, WebGL2 may be unavailable, and <c>fxBootstrap.js</c> skips the
/// motion-heavy modules outright under reduced motion — so every call is a
/// best-effort no-op rather than a throw. The quality tier and reduce-motion
/// gates live inside the JS modules; callers here must not second-guess them.
