// acoustics.js — per-game reverb spaces and doppler (§GFX-10).
//
// THE PROBLEM WITH ONE REVERB
// audioBus.js shipped with a single synthesised impulse response: 1.9 s of
// exponentially-decaying noise. That is a serviceable "generic room", and it is
// wrong in every game. PoBrawl is a hard-walled arena where a hit should slap
// back off the far side. PoRacer is outdoors — there is nothing to reflect off,
// and a 1.9 s tail there sounds like driving inside a cathedral. ConnectFive is
// a plastic board an arm's length away, where the only reverb is the room you
// are sitting in.
//
// HOW THESE IRs ARE BUILT
// Not just decaying noise. A real impulse response has two parts and the ear
// reads them differently:
//
//   EARLY REFLECTIONS — a handful of discrete, sparse taps in the first ~80 ms.
//   These are what tell you the SIZE and SHAPE of the space; their delays are
//   the actual path lengths off the nearest surfaces. Noise alone has no early
//   structure, which is why a pure-noise reverb always sounds like "reverb"
//   rather than like a place.
//
//   LATE DIFFUSE TAIL — exponentially decaying noise, additionally darkened
//   over time by a one-pole lowpass whose coefficient tightens as the tail
//   decays. Air and soft surfaces absorb high frequencies faster than low ones,
//   so a tail that keeps its brightness to the end sounds synthetic.
//
// The two channels get different tap patterns and independent noise, which is
// what produces stereo width. Identical channels collapse to a mono image in
// the middle of your head.
//
// Everything is generated at runtime: no IR files to download, and the buffers
// are cached per space per sample rate.
