// connectfive/index.js — physics-driven disc drop + chain reaction for ConnectFive (§CF-1).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// §GFX-1 brought the chip-drop audio + impact cue to ConnectFive but the visual
// drop itself remained a CSS keyframe (cf-slide-down). That keyframe already
// overshoots and squashes — it reads as "physical" for a single disc — but it
// drops the same distance into every row, so a disc landing on a tall pile
// falls through the discs already there. matter.js gives the new disc a real
// collision body inside a real column, so it falls exactly as far as the pile
// leaves it and thumps onto the stack.
//
// THE COLUMN IS THE MODEL (2026-09-12). Each drop builds three static bodies
// around the falling disc: two walls on the column's own boundaries and one
// support plank whose top face is the top of the pile. A single rigid body
// cannot tell a plank from the discs it stands for — but it very much can tell
// a FLAT surface from a round one, which is what the previous per-disc circular
// "ghost" bodies were. A circle resting on a circle is unstable equilibrium, so
// with no wall to stop it the disc rolled off the pile and drifted across the
// board (measured: landing in column 3, coming to rest at column 3.54, with its
// real cell still hidden behind it). Walls + a flat pile top is the whole fix.
//
// QUALITY GATES (same shape as impactBus.js / glassFx.js):
//   • reduced motion      → fall back to the keyframe, never spawn the engine
//   • low quality tier    → fall back to the keyframe
//   • matter.js not on window (CDN blocked / offline)
//                          → window.PoConnectFive is never set; the Blazor
//                            call below the page makes hits a thrown JS error
//                            which the page catches and the keyframe runs.
//   • any uncaught throw during the drop
//                          → cancelDrop() reveals the static disc on the next
//                            frame so a mid-drop failure never leaves the
//                            board blank.
//
// BUNDLE IMPACT: zero. matter.min.js loads from the jsdelivr CDN as a
// classic-script dependency injected by engineLoader.js; the trimmed WASM
// bundle does not include it. The cost is paid only by sessions that actually
// visit /connectfive.
