// engineLoader.js — route-gated loading for the per-game engines.
//
// ── Why ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// index.html used to load every game engine eagerly on first paint: pomarblerace,
// pobrawl, posports, poracer and posurvive, plus their three.js / cannon-es
// imports. That is ~24,600 lines of JavaScript parsed and executed to render a
// menu — and the overwhelming majority of sessions never open more than one
// game, if any. On a mid-range phone it is the single largest cost between
// "navigation started" and "home page interactive".
//
// ── Contract preserved exactly ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each engine's index.js assigns a global (window.PoBrawl, window.PoMarbleRace,
// …) and every Blazor page calls through that global. Nothing about that
// changes. This module only defers WHEN the module is evaluated; the call sites
// stay `JS.InvokeVoidAsync("PoBrawl.init", …)`.
//
// A page awaits `loadEngine('pobrawl')` once, before its first interop call.
// After that the global is present and behaves identically to the eager build.
//
// Concurrency: the promise is cached per engine, so two components racing to
// load the same engine share one network fetch and one module evaluation.
// A failed load is NOT cached — the entry is dropped so a later retry (e.g.
// after the player reconnects) can genuinely re-attempt instead of replaying a
// rejected promise forever.

// Paths are relative to the DOCUMENT base (index.html's <base href>), never to
// this module. See resolve() for why that distinction is load-bearing.

/**
 * Is a WebGL context obtainable at all?
 *
 * 2026-08-07 browser audit #5: three of the engines (PoBrawl, PoMarbleRace,
 * PoRacer) are three.js and cannot render without one. When the context could
 * not be created — a blocklisted GPU driver, hardware acceleration switched off,
 * some enterprise policies, a very old device — they threw from inside their
 * constructor and the player got Blazor's raw "An unhandled error has occurred.
 * Reload" bar with no explanation. GameShell probes this first and shows a real
 * message instead.
 *
 * Only a POSITIVE result is cached. Creating and discarding contexts is not
 * free, so a "yes" is remembered for the page lifetime — but a "no" is NOT
 * durable the way this once assumed. `getContext` returns null on transient
 * conditions too: the browser is at its live-context ceiling at that instant
 * (Chrome allows ~16 per renderer process, and every 3D game in this SPA holds
 * one while it is mounted), or the GPU process is mid-restart. Caching that
 * answer pinned "This game needs 3D graphics" onto every three.js game for the
 * rest of the tab's life, with a hard reload as the only way out — the failure
 * looked permanent and machine-wide when it was neither.
 *
 * Re-probing on a negative costs one throwaway canvas per navigation into a 3D
 * game, which is nothing next to the engine boot that follows it.
 *
 * The throwaway canvas is never attached to the DOM, and we explicitly lose the
 * context so the probe does not itself consume one of the pool slots it is
 * competing for.
