// gl-fps.js — global requestAnimationFrame-driven FPS sampler.
// Drives the top-nav <FpsCounter /> on every page. Self-stops on `beforeunload`
// so navigating away doesn't leak a callback.
//
// Single-instance, but *last writer wins*: `start` adopts the newest ref rather
// than no-op'ing on a second call, and `stop(token)` only tears the loop down if
// the caller still owns it. The badge is unconditional as of 2026-08-11, and the
// app swaps whole layouts (MainLayout ↔ PoSurviveLayout ↔ BareLayout) on
// navigation — each carrying its own <FpsCounter />. With a first-writer-wins
// start and an unconditional stop, an incoming counter that mounted before the
// outgoing one disposed would be silently killed by its predecessor's stop and
// the badge would stay blank until a full reload.
