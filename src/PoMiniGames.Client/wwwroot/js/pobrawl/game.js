// One 0..1 pool per fighter — the blue bar under the HP bar in the Blazor HUD.
// It is BOTH how hard this fighter's strikes land and whether they are allowed
// to throw one at all.
//
// 2026-09-12 rework (user request: "make blocking more rewarded and pure
// offensive a bad strategy"). The old pool was filled by the wind-up itself and
// emptied in full on release, which made offence free: an attack at an empty
// bar was still a legal attack at the 1x multiplier, so mashing punch threw
// unlimited weak strikes forever and there was no reason to ever stop swinging.
// "Holding the attack button refills the bar" is also flatly incompatible with
// "throwing lots of punches drains the bar", so the wind-up no longer creates
// energy — it SPENDS it:
//
//   • winding up drains the pool into the strike (chargeAmt), so the coil is
//     paid for out of the bar and the bar visibly empties as you load up;
//   • releasing costs a further flat ATTACK_ENERGY_COST, which is what taxes
//     tap-spam — a jab banks almost no charge but still pays the toll;
//   • dropping under the floor GASSES the fighter: no punch, no kick, at all,
//     until they have recovered back up to ENERGY_RECOVER_TO (see _canAttack);
//   • blocking refills it fast, idling refills it slowly, and swinging refills
//     it not at all.
//
// The net effect is that a pure-offence rush runs itself out of the ability to
// fight inside a few seconds and then stands there defenceless, while guarding
// is how a fighter buys the power for the next exchange.
// Both fighters come out of the corner fresh. The old 1/3 bank made sense when
// the wind-up REFILLED the bar (you were expected to charge it up yourself);
// now that attacking is what drains it, opening at 1/3 would gas a fighter out
// after two jabs before the round had really started. A full bar is worth
// roughly four spammed punches, or one fully committed haymaker.
