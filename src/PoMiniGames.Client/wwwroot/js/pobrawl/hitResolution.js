// Split out of game.js 2026-09-23. _tryHit alone was ~550 lines — the single largest
// method in the engine — and it is also the method every new combat rule has to
// thread through, so it now reads as a short pipeline over named steps
// (_resolveBlock, _rollHitDamage, _landHit, _resolveCombatEvents, _heavyHitStagger).
// Mixed into BrawlGame's prototype like the other subsystems (see mixin.js), so
// `this` is the live game and every `this._foo()` call site is unchanged.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The seeded RNG draws in this file (Obama's dodge, Nixon's
// dirty swing, the damage jitter, the blood roll, the KO shot, the celebration) run
// in exactly the order they ran inside the old monolith, which is what keeps a demo
// replay reproducible across the split. Reordering the steps reorders the draws.

// ── Dismemberment ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// When the arms region reddens, an arm tears off and falls to the canvas with a
// silly blood squirt. The non-punching (LEFT) arm goes first (>= ARM_SEVER_L)
// so the fighter keeps its striking arm — with one arm you can only punch with
// that (right) arm. The right/striking arm only tears off once the left is
// already gone and damage is near-max (ARM_SEVER_R); after that the fighter has
// no arms and can only kick.

// live here are gone. The canvas plane and the ragdoll contact material own
// clearance, bounce and damping.)

// How much harder a CHARGED "power" hit chews the struck limb vs a tap. Region
// (limb) damage is what reddens the body-diagram section and eventually tears an
// arm off; a full-charge blow adds this multiple of extra region damage on top
// of the base so a couple of power shots to one arm sever it before the KO. The
// bonus scales with charge (0 at a tap, full at max charge) — see the region
// damage line in _resolveHit. Without it, region damage tracked HP too closely
// and the match always ended before any single limb reddened enough (the
// symptom the demo showed: limbs never fell off).
const REGION_CHARGE_BONUS = 1.8;
// A charged power blow that lands elsewhere still rattles the defender's
// guarding arms — this fraction of the hit bleeds into the arms region so a
// sustained power beating reddens and eventually tears an arm off even without
// clean arm hits (which are geometrically rare: a straight strike lands on the
// torso/head, not the arms hanging at the sides). Scales with charge; a tap

// branch of _applyHit.

//
// 2026-09-13: this used to be spelled inline as a literal 0.5 guarded by
// `attack.name === 'punch'`, so a blocked KICK cost the attacker nothing at all
// — they recovered on their normal schedule and were free to swing again before
// the defender could answer. That made the guard a coin-flip mechanic: reading a
// punch was a turn, reading a kick was a shrug, and since kicks are also the
// swing that beats a standing guard (the guard capsules only cover the forearms,
// see testAttackBlocked) the AI's whole answer to a defensive player was the one
// attack blocking did not punish. Every blocked swing now pays the same freeze.
//
// 0.5 s is roughly one attack's full cycle, so a block is unambiguously the
// defender's turn: enough for a jab plus its recovery, not enough for a free
// three-hit string. A PERFECT guard still buys more (PERFECT_GUARD_STUN) plus
// the energy, the plant and the counter window — the read is still worth more
// than the camp, which is the point of splitting the reward at all.
const BLOCK_STUN = 0.5;

// ── Perfect guard ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// 2026-09-12, same brief as the energy rework above ("force the player to
// learn to use the block action"). The energy economy already made blocking
// the correct long-run play, but it paid the same whether you read the swing
// or simply stood there holding guard all round — and a button you can hold is
// not a skill anyone learns. So the reward is split in two:
//
//   • an ORDINARY block (guard already up when the strike lands) keeps exactly
//     what it paid before: absorb the hit, bank BLOCK_ENERGY_REWARD × charge;
//   • a PERFECT guard — the guard went up inside PERFECT_GUARD_WINDOW of the
//     strike connecting, i.e. you reacted to the wind-up rather than camping —
//     banks several times the energy, freezes the attacker long enough for a
//     free answer, and arms a damage bonus on your next swing.
//
// The window is deliberately generous at 0.22 s. It is measured from the guard
// going up, not from the strike's active frames, so it is a reaction test, not
// a frame-perfect one: against a coil you can see coming, a player who guards
// on the tell gets it every time and a player who holds guard from three
// seconds out never does. That asymmetry is the whole mechanic — turtling
// still survives, but only reading the fight wins it.

// back most of a bar, which is what pays for the counter the freeze opens up.

// How long the attacker is frozen out of their own recovery. Longer than the
// BLOCK_STUN an ordinary block already costs them — the point is that reading
// the swing is unambiguously worth more than standing behind the guard.
// Deliberately not much longer: blockStunT suppresses the victim's guard as
// well as their attacks, so this window is un-defendable, and anything past
