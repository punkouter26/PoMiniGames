// eventFx.js — sim events become things you can see, hear and feel (GFX options 2 and 8).
//
// The sim already announces lightning, rockslides and eruptions on the `events` channel.
// Until now the ONLY reaction was a centred audio stinger: the screen did not move, no
// dust rose, and a strike two hundred metres away was indistinguishable from one at the
// player's feet. This module is the router that was missing.
//
// It owns three things:
//
//   EVENTS    kind + tile → a world position → particles, camera trauma via
//             the app-wide impact bus, a rack focus, and a positioned stinger. Everything
//             scales with distance, so a far-off eruption is a rumble on the horizon and a
//             near one takes the screen.
//   TILES     continuous emitters for fire and lava, budgeted per frame. A burning forest
//             is the single biggest particle consumer in the game, so it is metered rather
//             than emitted per tile.
//   PROPS     the physics-visual coupling. cannon-es has been throwing logs, rocks and
//             ragdolls around since the game shipped and NOTHING reacted when they landed.
//
// WHY THE PROP IMPACTS ARE DETECTED HERE AND NOT IN THE SIM
// The obvious implementation is a cannon `collide` listener in sim/physics/world.js. That
// would mean a new worker message, a change to a module whose determinism is load-bearing,
// and a cosmetic concern living inside the simulation. Instead this watches the prop rows
// the render frame already carries and looks for a sharp drop in vertical speed. It is
// approximate — a body whose row index shifts is simply skipped that frame — and that is
// fine, because a missed dust puff is invisible and the sim stays untouched.
