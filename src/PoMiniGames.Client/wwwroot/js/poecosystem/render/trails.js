// trails.js — desire paths and fresh tracks (GFX pass 2, idea 1).
//
// The sim already moves every creature across the ground; nothing on the ground ever
// remembered it. This module is that memory, and it is render-only: it reads the
// interpolated creature rows the renderer already has and never talks to the worker, so
// the sim's determinism cannot notice it exists.
//
// One RG texture at TEXELS_PER_METRE over the island:
//
//   R  WEAR   slow to build, slow to fade (minutes). Where many feet pass the grass gives
//             way to packed earth, so migration routes, the path from the huts to the
//             water and the wolves' patrol loop appear on their own over a session.
//   G  FRESH  fast to build, fast to fade (tens of seconds). The trample channel: grass
//             blades (grass.js) flatten where it is high, snow shows the ground through
//             it, wet sand darkens. A fleeing herd leaves a visible wake.
//
// CPU side is two Float32 grids; the per-frame work is one stamp per MOVING creature
// (<= 400), and the decay + byte pack runs at UPLOAD_HZ, not per frame, because a trail
// that fades on a 4 Hz step is indistinguishable from one that fades continuously.
//
// Nothing here is saved: a reload starts with clean ground, which is fine for a surface
// effect and keeps the snapshot format untouched.
