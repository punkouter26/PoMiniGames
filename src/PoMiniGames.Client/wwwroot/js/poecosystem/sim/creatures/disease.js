// disease.js — contagion (feature #8, 2026-09-23). The island had predators and famine
// but nothing that answered overcrowding, so a rabbit boom only ended when the grass did.
// A species over its DISEASE.outbreakDensity can catch a sickness; it spreads by contact
// to the same species, drains health while it lasts, and survivors are immune for a while.
//
// Stepped once a second. Draws come from the `ecology` stream only, and iteration is in
// ascending index order, so a world stays deterministic per seed with disease on.
