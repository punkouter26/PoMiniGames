// Real-marble physics. The world is scaled at 1 unit = 1 cm, so a radius-1 marble is a 20 mm
// glass "shooter" (see marbles.js for the ~10.5 g mass that implies). Gravity is a weighty,
// natural fall — stronger than the old floaty arcade value but deliberately short of a literal
// 9.8 m/s² (which at this scale would be 981 u/s² and run the race ~8× faster). The floor has
// real friction, so marbles ROLL down the course (angular velocity coupling to linear) the way
// real marbles do, instead of sliding.
//
// GRAVITY survived the move to the authored course (2026-08-10) on purpose, even though the
// course is much shallower than the old chute (average slope 0.27 against 0.42). The reason is
// that raising or lowering it changes nothing about whether marbles hold the banked turns: the
// speed a marble reaches on a ramp and the speed a banked turn is designed for BOTH scale as
// sqrt(g), so the ratio between them — which is what decides how high a marble rides — is
// gravity-independent. What holds the pack in is the authored geometry: 24° of bank on the
// start helix rising to near-vertical through the Track-LowerA/B loops, with a wall 8.3 units
// tall (four marble diameters) at every channel edge.
export const GRAVITY = 72;        // world gravity magnitude (down -Y) — weighty, and enough to

// 1/60, halved from 1/120 when the procedural chute was replaced by the authored course
// (2026-08-10). Not a preference — a budget. Colliding 101 marbles against a trimesh course costs
// ~16.5 ms per step at the start line (the worst case, with the whole field still bunched), so at
// 1/120 the physics alone wanted ~33 ms per rendered frame and the race would have run in slow
// motion. One step per frame at 60 Hz fits.
//
// The trade is integration accuracy, and the margin that matters is tunnelling: the fastest
// marbles observed on this course run ~55 u/s, which is 0.92 units per step here, against a
// marble 2 units across. The surface catches it with better than 2x to spare, and would keep
// doing so up to ~120 u/s. Raising this back to 1/120 is safe for physics and NOT safe for the
// frame budget — check the step cost before considering it.
