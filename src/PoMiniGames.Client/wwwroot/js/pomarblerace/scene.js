// High, pulled-back overview: a positive default pitch orbits the camera UP and
// behind the leader so it looks down into the channel over the tall walls,
// showing a complete view of the pack and the track ahead.
// Raised and pulled back with the road: at CHANNEL_WIDTH 64 the old 26/46 vantage framed
// about a third of the chute's width, so marbles kept fighting off-screen.
// The camera now locks to the PLAYER'S marble (see _pickShot), which is a marble you steer —
// so the framing is a chase cam, not a pack overview: closer and a touch lower than the old
// broadcast vantage, tilted enough to read the road ahead so you can steer toward boost pads
// and away from the fall-off edge.
//
// CHASE, FLATTENED: the previous 52/38 vantage sat almost on top of the marble (≈58° down),
// so the frame was floor-plus-berms and the road ahead was a thin sliver at the top — the ramp
// was unreadable. Pulling BACK rather than UP flattens the look angle to ≈40° and lets the
// chute recede into frame, which is what makes the ramp legible.
// RESCALED for the authored course (2026-08-10). The old 46/62 vantage was sized against the
// procedural chute: a 64-wide road with 44-tall berms, straight enough that a 62-unit lookback
// still saw down it. The authored course is a different size in both directions — the channel
// is 24-30 units across for most of its length (17 through Lane2) and the walls are 8.3 tall —
// and, more importantly, the start helix turns on a 56-unit radius. A camera 62 units back from
// a marble on that helix sits outside the spiral entirely and shoots through the track above it.
// Pulled in to roughly the same fraction of the channel width the old framing had. The berm
