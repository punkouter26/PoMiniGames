// postFx.js — post-processing pieces shared by the three.js games (§GFX-2).
//
// PoBrawl and PoMarbleRace each built their own composer, and each one grew a
// slightly different version of the same ideas. What is here is the part that
// genuinely wants to be shared:
//
//   RACK FOCUS   a depth-of-field pass that is OFF during play and ramps in for
//                a moment on a KO / photo finish. This is the cinematic trick
//                the two games were missing, and doing it as a transient pass
//                rather than an always-on one is what makes it affordable.
//   PUNCH        one function that turns impactBus's 0..1 envelope into the
//                aberration/radial-blur values the games' own shaders already
//                have. Before this, PoBrawl decayed its own caPulse and the DOM
//                shook on a different curve, so a single hit produced two
//                slightly out-of-sync reactions.
//   TIER         the shared read of visualRuntime.js's data-gfx attribute, so
//                "what can this machine afford" is answered the same way in
//                both engines.
//
// WHY DoF IS ONLY EVER TRANSIENT
// BokehPass renders the scene a second time with a depth override material. At
// 60 fps during play that is a permanent doubling of the draw-call count for an
// effect nobody looks at while they are concentrating on the game. Enabled for
// the ~1.2 s of a KO — when the action has already stopped — it costs nothing
// that matters and is the single most "expensive-looking" thing in the app.
//
// A disabled pass is skipped entirely by EffectComposer, including its depth
// prepass, so the off state really is free.
