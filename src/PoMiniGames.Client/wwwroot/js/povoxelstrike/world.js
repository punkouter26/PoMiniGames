// world.js — seeded arena build: block terrain + THE FORTRESS.
//
// The arena is no longer a scattered settlement. It is one concentric fortress standing
// on a levelled plateau at the centre of the map:
//
//        outer curtain wall (bastions at 4 corners, gatehouse facing spawn)
//          └─ outer ward: castles, cottages, towers
//               └─ inner curtain wall (bastions, gate on the OPPOSITE side)
//                    └─ inner ward
//                         └─ great keep → the golden chalice
//
// The player spawns outside on +Z and wins by reaching the chalice. Every wall is a
// normal destructible Structure, so "break through" is literal: the layout only decides
// where the stone starts.
//
// The two gates are deliberately on opposite faces. A straight run from spawn to the
// vault does not exist — you either walk the long way around the outer ward under the
// guns, or you make your own door. That choice is the whole game.
//
// Placement is still seeded, so a seed reproduces the same ward furniture; the ring
// geometry itself is fixed, because a fortress whose walls move is not a fortress.
