// routeFx.js — the route-transition wipe (§GFX).
//
// Navigating between the catalog and a game was an instant DOM swap: one frame
// the gallery, the next frame a game. Nothing told the player the app had moved,
// and nothing connected the accent they were about to be surrounded by to the
// card they had just pressed.
//
// This is a ~260 ms wipe tinted to the DESTINATION's palette, so the transition
// is also the introduction to where you are going. paletteBus already owns the
// per-game palettes (it re-points --fx-accent on every route change) — this
// reads the same table rather than keeping a second copy that could disagree.
//
// Why a DOM overlay and not a shader: postFx.js is three.js-only (it imports
// BokehPass and hands numbers to the games' own shaders), so it has nothing to
// say about a page transition. A single compositor-friendly element animating
// opacity and transform is also the only version of this that cannot drop a
// frame on the low tier — which matters, because this effect runs on the one
// frame the app is already busiest.
//
// Exposed as window.PoRouteFx.
