/// restating them, so a rename lands on the ladder, the HUD and the Elo board together.
/// One cross-language copy remains — <c>wwwroot/js/pobrawl/fighters.js</c> <c>CHARACTERS</c>,
/// which the engine simulates — and it is the only list that has to be kept in step by hand.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The allowlist is what bounds the board. Rating rows are keyed by fighter id, so an
/// unvalidated id is a free row-multiplier — exactly the hazard
/// <see cref="T:PoMiniGames.Infrastructure.Services.HighScoreDescriptor`1"/> warns about for
/// RowKey fields. Accepting only ids that exist here keeps the partition bounded at
/// <see cref="Count"/> rows forever, no matter what a caller posts. The display name is
/// resolved here rather than taken from the request for the same reason: the board must not
/// render caller-supplied strings.

/// <b><see cref="Bob"/> is deliberately not in <see cref="Fighters"/>.</b> He is the 1-player
/// avatar and a 2-player pick, never a demo-mode combatant (demo draws both fighters from the
