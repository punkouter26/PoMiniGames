/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this is not <see cref="EloCalculator"/>.</b> That one rates a player against a
/// <em>fixed</em> virtual AI rating per difficulty tier, which buys it a valuable property:
/// the result depends only on the accumulated win/loss/draw counts, so it can be recomputed
/// from scratch at any time and backfilled onto legacy rows. Head-to-head Elo cannot have
/// that property — each match is scored against the opponent's rating <em>at that moment</em>,
/// so the outcome is path-dependent and the stored rating is the only record of the history.
/// Do not try to unify the two; the difference is the point.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Zero-sum by construction.</b> The delta is computed once, rounded once, and applied as
/// <c>+d</c> to one side and <c>-d</c> to the other, so the rating pool is conserved exactly
/// and cannot drift from rounding both sides independently. The one exception is
/// <see cref="EloOptions.FighterFloorElo"/>: a fighter already at the floor absorbs less than
/// the full loss, and the floor deliberately wins over conservation. Without it a roster
/// outlier left running on an unattended kiosk grinds to a negative rating that reads as a
/// bug on the board.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Callers must apply the returned values as <em>increments</em> to whatever the stored
/// rating is at write time, not as absolute values computed from the read. Increments
/// commute, so two demo matches finishing concurrently compose correctly instead of one
/// silently overwriting the other.
