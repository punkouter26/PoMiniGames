// Until 2026-09-14 each game declared its own LobbyState/LobbyEvent pair with the same
// four fields, which is what let the four lobby pages and four lobby services drift
// into four copies. A game's player record still carries whatever that game needs
// (a character, a fighter, a seat number) — it just has to expose the four fields the
// shared lobby machinery reads.

/// <summary>The fields every lobby seat exposes; the shared room, hub and panel read nothing else.</summary>
