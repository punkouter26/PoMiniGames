// What the server broadcasts and what the client sends during a live 1v1.
//
// The fight is GGPO-style rollback with the server as input relay and referee. Both browsers
// and the server step the same integer, 60 Hz simulation (PoBrawlRollbackSim here, and its
// bit-identical twin wwwroot/js/pobrawl/rollbackSim.js). A client never reports a hit: it
// reports frame-stamped inputs, the server decides on which frame each one happened and echoes
// it to everyone, and the server alone declares the result.

/// <summary>
/// One input event a client sends on every input change: the corner's HELD state (Idle,
/// MoveForward, MoveBack or Block — it persists until the next event, so the client sends one on
/// key-up too) and, optionally, an attack PRESS (Punch, Kick or Special, buffered one deep behind
/// the cooldown).

/// applies the input at max(<see cref="Frame"/>, its frame + 1) — it never rewrites its own past —
/// and echoes the frame it used in a <see cref="PoBrawlMatchInputEvent"/>.
