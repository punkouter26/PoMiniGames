///
/// These tests assert the HTML shape of the home route because the Blazor
/// WASM client is now BFF-served (no separate Vite/Node). The deeper
/// component-level coverage (button clicks, navigation, game-specific
/// selectors) lives in the unit tests under tests/UnitTests/Features
/// via bUnit-style assertions; the e2e project only asserts the
/// public-facing HTTP contract here.
