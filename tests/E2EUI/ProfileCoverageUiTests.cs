/// <summary>
/// §5 E2E-UI coverage for the profile page's game roster and the offline treatment.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// These live in the browser tier rather than a cheaper one because both surfaces are
/// only reachable through a real browser: the profile's rating classification is
/// private to the Razor component and reads localStorage over JS interop, and the
/// offline treatment is driven by <c>navigator.onLine</c>. Neither has a seam the
/// Unit or Integration tiers can reach without inventing one that exists only for
/// tests.
///
/// Scope limit: the published service worker is NOT exercised here. The test host
/// serves the no-op development worker (see wwwroot/service-worker.js), so real
/// cache-first offline loading has to be verified against published output. What is
/// covered here is the offline *UX contract* — banner shown, network-dependent games
/// made unavailable — which is what regresses silently.
/// </remarks>
