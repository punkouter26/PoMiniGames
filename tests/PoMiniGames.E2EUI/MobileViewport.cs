/// <b>§9 Mobile-First Rule.</b> The original tests called
/// <c>browser.NewPageAsync()</c> without a viewport override, which left Chromium
/// at its default 1280×720 desktop layout. That layout differs from the production
/// mobile render tree in CSS-grid order, top-bar density, and chip wrap behaviour
/// — so a "mobile-first smoke" was actually a desktop test in disguise. Pinning the
/// viewport at the canonical phone dimensions (iPhone 14 logical resolution) makes
/// the suite honest about what it covers.
