/// Zero-Waste budget guardrail for the entire automated test suite.

/// E2E-API host, E2E-UI Kestrel host) MUST apply <see cref="Overrides"/> before any HTTP
/// request is served. The intent is structural: even if a developer has live Azure OpenAI
/// keys wired in <c>appsettings.Development.json</c> or <c>dotnet user-secrets</c>, the
/// overrides pin every AI boundary to its in-process mock implementation so the suite can
/// never spend live tokens, accidentally incur a 429, or leak a deployment name.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>§8 Cost-Waste Guardrails — single source of truth.</b> Earlier drafts of the
/// fixtures duplicated the override dictionary inline in
/// <c>TestWebApplicationFactory.ConfigureWebHost</c>, <c>KestrelServerFixture.ConfigureWebHost</c>,
/// and <c>PoMiniGamesE2EFixture.ConfigureWebHost</c>. Drift between those copies was the
/// primary reason <c>IFaceAnalysisService</c> (AzureAIFaceAnalysisService) was missed — only
/// the PoFunQuiz / PoCoupleQuiz overrides existed.</para>
/// <para><b>Pattern:</b> Immutable shared dictionary. Adding a new AI boundary requires
/// exactly one edit here; the next build of any fixture picks it up automatically.</para>
